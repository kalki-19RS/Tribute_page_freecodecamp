            <ul id="tribute-info">
                <li><span class="bold">1986 - </span> Aaron Swartz was born in Highland Park, 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Chicago</li>
                <li><span class="bold">1999 - </span> At age twelve, he created the website The Info Network, a user-generated encyclopedia. The site won the ArsDigita Prize.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">2000 - </span> At the age of 14, he co-authored RSS version 1.0, and shortly thereafter joined a working group at the World Wide Web Consortium to help develop common data formats used on the World Wide Web.</li>
               <li><span class="bold">2008 - </span> He founded Watchdog.net, to create greater political transparency and help citizens organize at a grassroots level. </li>
                <li><span class="bold">2010 - </span> He founded the online group Demand Progress, which launched a successful campaign against two Internet censorship bills (SOPA/PIPA), 
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold">2011 - </span>Swartz played a significant role in making government and academic data more available for free to the public. In 2011, Swartz was accused of using an MIT computer system to download numerous academic articles from the online archive JSTOR. JSTOR decided not to pursue charges, and asked the government not to prosecute, but Swartz was indicted by federal prosecutors for 13 felony charges. Prosecutors refused all settlement offers that did not include jail time, and required Swartz to plead guilty to felony charges.
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold">2013 - </span>The case was pending when Swartz died at age 26 in January 2013. Concerns that the charges were excessive have led to a Congressional investigation of the way prosecutors handled the case. Since then, Swartz’s case has inspired proposed amendments to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act that would remove the “dangerously broad criminalization of online activity,” according to the American Civil Liberties Union.
